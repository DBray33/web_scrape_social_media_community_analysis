# Multi-Platform Digital Community Discovery System

> A comprehensive data collection and analysis system for identifying, categorizing, and analyzing digital communities where students and emerging professionals are active online.

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates advanced web scraping, API integration, and data analysis techniques for collecting and processing community data across multiple platforms. Built as a portfolio project for web/data scraping specialist positions, it showcases the ability to ethically collect, process, and derive insights from online community data.

The system discovers, categorizes, and analyzes communities across Reddit, Discord, Instagram, and Facebook, building a structured cross-platform database to power targeted outreach campaigns for student and professional audiences.

## Project Status

**All Components Implemented:**

- Reddit API Integration and Analysis
- Discord Community Discovery via Reddit

- Facebook Groups Discovery and Analysis
- Cross-Platform Data Integration

## Key Achievements

- **Reddit Communities**: Identified and analyzed 185 relevant communities (99 student-focused, 77 professional-focused, 9 mixed)
- **Discord Servers**: Discovered 35 active servers with a total of 447,834 members
- **Instagram Communities**: Analyzed community demographics and content patterns across approximately 40 education and career-focused accounts

### Data Collection & Processing

- Targeted community discovery across platforms
- Keyword-based relevance scoring for student/professional communities
- Standardized data structures for cross-platform compatibility
- Comprehensive metadata collection (size, activity, focus areas)
- Ethical data sampling approaches for restricted platforms

### Analysis & Visualization

- Community categorization by focus area (student, professional, mixed)
- Engagement metrics calculation and comparison
- Visualizations of community distributions and relationships
- Size vs. relevance analysis across platforms
- Content theme analysis using NLP techniques
- Cross-platform engagement normalization for fair comparison

### Data Management

- Structured storage system for raw and processed data
- Multiple export formats (CSV, JSON)
- Data validation and quality assurance processes
- Unified database structure for standardized metrics

## Installation & Setup

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/web-scraping-portfolio.git
cd web-scraping-portfolio
```

2. Create a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

- Facebook groups demonstrate most consistent topic-focused discussions
- Professional development communities show similar engagement patterns across all platforms

## Ethical Considerations

This system:

- Respects platform-specific rate limits to prevent service disruption
- Only collects publicly available information
- Follows each platform's Terms of Service and API usage policies
- Implements appropriate delays between requests
- Uses simulation for platforms with restricted access
- Does not store personally identifiable information
